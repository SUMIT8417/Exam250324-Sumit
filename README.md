## Part A
I'm working on a team with a few developers using Git on Bitbucket. We are all working on a dev branch, not pushing to master until a release.
One of the developers committed incorrect code that overwrote my own by accident, and now I am trying to push the correct code back to the repository.
I follow the instructions and pull, but then I receive a merge conflict.
After entering a message for the merge conflict, my local code is now the incorrect code that the other developer uploaded by accident (as expected from the pull).
So I replace the incorrect code with the backup I copied before committing, and when I try to push again, I get the same error.
